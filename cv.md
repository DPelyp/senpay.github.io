### Development-focused tester && test-focused developer. Software craftsperson.

I do not believe in test-last approach. I don't believe that one can test quality-in. I think that the best way to efficiently and cost-effectively improve product quality is to change the way we:
  -  Define what should be implemented (and make sure this should be implemented at all)
  -  Start with the question "How do I know that I completed implementation?", i.e. test-first approach/(A)TDD
  -  Write code that is easy to read for human, rather than a computer
  -  Use application architecture as a primary means of ensuring effective automated checking rather than rely on and/or develop "test automation" solutions, which are even more complex that system under test
  -  Use "Layered Quality Gates" approach

**To make this happen:**
  -  I talk at conferences and share my ideas and know-how
  -  I publish my ideas and know-how on the internet
  -  I provide workshops at the conferences and on requests where I show how my ideas and know-how can be used on practices
