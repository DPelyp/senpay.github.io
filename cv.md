## Development-focused tester && test-focused developer. Software craftsperson.

I do not believe in test-last approach. I don't believe that one can test quality-in. I think that the best way to efficiently and cost-effectively improve product quality is to change the way we:
  -  Define what should be implemented (and make sure this should be implemented at all)
  -  Start with the question "How do I know that I completed implementation?", i.e. test-first approach/(A)TDD
  -  Write code that is easy to read and change for human, rather than a computer
  -  Use application architecture as a primary means of ensuring effective automated checking rather than rely on and/or develop "test automation" solutions, which are even more complex that system under test
  -  Use "Layered Quality Gates" approach

**To make this happen:**
  -  I talk at conferences and share my ideas and know-how
  -  I publish my ideas and know-how on the internet
  -  I provide workshops at the conferences and on requests where I show how my ideas and know-how can be used on practice

## About me
All of the above are areas of my professional interest and expertise. I started my professional path as Test Engineer, was testing and developing test tools for more than 5 years and finally was promoted to a leadership position. After joining a Toptal, one of the best companies I have ever had a chance to work with, I was given a unique opportunity to start my Software Craftsperson journey and work with the best of the best engineers worldwide.

At the moment I am on yet another exciting journey exploring DevOps philosophy and toolchain at Xilinx, UK.

## Tools and technologies I have used

On numerous occasions throughout my career I had to change the tools I use. I am more than surprised when someone requires knowledge of a particular tool from an engineer with more than 5 years of experience.

The best tool that I have ever had to use is the thing that sits on my shoulders. However, I have also worked with PHP, VB.Net, SQL, Java, C#, Python, Groovy, JavaScript

Projects that I worked with were anything from Web-based to Desktop applications; from E-Commerce to AI and Data Analysis.
